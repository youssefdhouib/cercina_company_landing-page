# Project Name
Cercina company

## Description

I developed a landing page web solution for a ship supply company, using React.js for structure and functionality. The site, built to the client's specifications, features a user-friendly form for data input. I integrated Email.js for automated email notifications upon form submission, ensuring efficient communication. I used some animations, including typing effects to enhance user interaction. Tailwind CSS was used for styling, and router for smooth navigation.
